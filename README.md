# Microsoft Movie Studios Project

## Introduction
This project aims to provide actionable insights to help Microsoft establish and excel in the movie industry. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we analyze various movie datasets to uncover trends and patterns that can guide decision-making for Microsoft's new movie studio.

## Business Understanding
### Business Problem
Microsoft lacks experience in the movie industry but intends to create a successful movie studio. The key challenge is understanding which types of movies are currently successful at the box office to inform decision-making on content creation.

### Objective
The objective is to provide actionable insights to the head of Microsoft's new movie studio, assisting in deciding what types of films to produce. This involves EDA to identify trends in genres, box office earnings, ratings, and release dates.

## Data Understanding
### Data Sources
The project utilizes movie datasets from various sources, including Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers.

### Data Preparation
The datasets are cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions. This ensures the quality and consistency of the data for analysis.

## Data Analysis
### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is conducted to analyze box office earnings, movie ratings, genres, and release dates. Visualizations are created to uncover insights and trends within the data.

## Visualization
Visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and line plots are utilized to present key findings from the analysis. These visualizations aid in understanding trends and patterns in the movie industry.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The analysis reveals insights into successful movie genres, box office trends, and audience preferences. Recommendations are provided for Microsoft's movie studio, focusing on content creation strategies and market targeting.
